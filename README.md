# Traveling Salesman Problem graphical interface
This is Traveling Salesman Problem basic graphical interface in vanilla JavaScript
# Why have I coded it?
I've written this to have some graphical representation of the algorithm.
# How to use it?
You only want to modify two things: 'coordinates' array and 'links' string.
To add the new city you just have to add the element (two element array -> x and y of the city) to 'coordinates'.
String 'links' tells what is the travel way -> example: for 'ACB' you just go from A to C and then go to B.
